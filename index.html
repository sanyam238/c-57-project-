    <p >  I like playing basketball because it helps me in my physical areas and it helps me get taller, which is a good thing. I started playing basketball a month ago and I instantly fell in love with the game.This hobby can be developed by anyone but however,I got this naturally because I was born tall and I really like throwing things.</p>
